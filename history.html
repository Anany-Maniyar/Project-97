                    Schindler was founded in 1874 in Lucerne, Switzerland, by precision engineer Robert Schindler. 125 years later, in 1998, the company established its 100% owned subsidiary in India and this is where our great journey began!

                <p id="work_page_para">
                    In its 145-year history, Schindler has grown from a local manufacturer of machines into a global elevator and escalator business. On the way, it has shaped the industry, defined best practice as a mobility provider and as an employer has prospered in a highly competitive global environment.
